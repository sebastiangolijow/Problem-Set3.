# Problem-Set3.
Complete the implementation of runoff.c in such a way that it simulates a runoff election. You should complete the implementations of the vote, tabulate, print_winner, find_min, is_tie, and eliminate functions, and you should not modify anything else in runoff.c (except you may include additional header files, if youâ€™d like).
